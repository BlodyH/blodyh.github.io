I am a current PhD student in the School of Computing and Information Systems (CIS) at the University of Melbourne (Unimelb), supervised by Associate Professor [Sarah Erfani](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/smonazam/) and Dr. [Feng Liu](https://fengliu90.github.io/). I previously completed a Master of Data Science at Unimelb under the supervision of Dr. [Mingming Gong](https://mingming-gong.github.io/) and Dr. [Liuhua Peng](https://sites.google.com/view/liuhua-peng), building on my academic background in statistics and deep learning. My research interests lie in deep learning and adversarial machine learning, with a particular focus on ensuring model robustness under distribution shift. I am particularly interested in trustworthy machine learning, including uncertainty quantification, robust representation learning, and defense strategies against adversarial attacks. I also work on time series analysis, exploring both theoretical and practical aspects to improve forecasting and representation learning for temporal data. Broadly, I aim to bridge statistical theory with modern machine learning to design models that are accurate, interpretable, and reliable in dynamic, real-world environments. Beyond research, I enjoy a wide range of sports, including basketball, badminton, karate, and hiking.
